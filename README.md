# Finding which demographics are most likely to commit suicide
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person committing suicide using classification models in Python.

Tools & Libraries

Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

Usage
To use this project, you can clone the repository and run the jupyter notebook file. This file contains the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and training and evaluating the classification models.

You can modify the code in suicide-rates.ipynb to use different classification models or to perform hyperparameter tuning for the models.
